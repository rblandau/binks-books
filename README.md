Collection of Bink's Books commentaries over the years

Bink's Books was an occasional collection of reviews of books by Ed Binkowski and some of his friends.  Inveterate reader Ed consumes more books in a week than a dozen average Americans read in a year.  No kidding.  And he has a number of other friends who contribute their opinions, too.  The result, over a decade or two, is several hundred pages of ratings and capsule reviews of *hundreds* of books.  

(I'm just the dumb editor who formats the documents in MS-Word to produce a navigable document.)  

This is a private collection for distribution only with the permission of the author, Dr. Edward S. Binkowski.
